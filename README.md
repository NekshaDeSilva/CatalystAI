<h1>Official Build of CatalystAI ©2025</h1>
<h2>Engineered, developed, designed by <a href="https://www.github.com/nekshadesilva">Neksha DeSilva</a>. Licenced via Apache-2.0 Contributor's License.</h2>

An advanced self-assessment and AI-powered analysis system for PDF documents, built on **Gemini Pro via LangChain** and **AstraDB**. This project offers intelligent document engagement, learning analytics, and structured conversation exports — all tailored for academic and deep research purposes.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Document Completion Score
Calculates **how much of the uploaded document** has been meaningfully covered through the conversation.  
Powered by:
- Total word count from the original document.
- Comparison with relevant academic/technical keywords found in user and AI exchanges.
- A refined logic engine using semantic and contextual mapping via Gemini.

---

### 🎯 Accuracy Score & Deep Search
Delivers **accuracy scoring** based on:
- Similarity between the AI response and the source document.
- Semantic alignment using LLM-powered comparisons.
- A **Deep Search** mode which intelligently scans wide-ranging sections of the document and external knowledge if needed, before generating responses.

---

### 🧠 Expert Mode *(Interactive Learning AI)*
When activated, **Expert Mode**:
- Analyzes the document context.
- Asks **smart, self-generated questions** based on the content.
- Immediately **answers those questions**, providing deeper understanding.
- Simulates expert tutoring behavior — perfect for exam prep, research, or revision.

---

### 💾 Export Facility
Allows seamless **JSON exports of entire chat sessions**, preserving:
- Questions asked by the user.
- Responses generated by the AI.
- Meta-analysis data (accuracy, document coverage, timestamps, etc.)

Ideal for:
- Academic revision
- Developer analytics
- Data science input sets
- Further LLM training or fine-tuning

---

### 🧩 Chat History Storage
Every interaction is **persistently stored** for:
- Session playback
- Ongoing progress tracking
- Re-assessment or backtracking

Data is neatly formatted for long-term use in both human-readable and programmatic formats.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Tech | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Gemini Pro (via LangChain)** | Natural Language Understanding, Deep Semantic Analysis |
| **AstraDB** | Document Storage and Metadata Management |
| **LangChain PromptTemplate** | Dynamic prompt injection and task definition |
| **JavaScript + HTML/CSS** | Frontend interactivity and UI control |
| **JSON Exporter** | Structured, portable conversation data |

---

## 🔍 Example Use-Case

> A student uploads a 5000-word research article and chats with the AI to understand it.  
The AI calculates a 74% completion score and a 91% accuracy score for the responses.  
Expert Mode then asks critical questions from the document and answers them.  
Finally, the session is exported as a `.json` file for later revision or further training.

---

## ✨ Vision

To build a **smart academic companion** that not only understands documents but helps users engage with them **intelligently** and **deeply** — tracking learning, improving accuracy, and making data truly interactive.
